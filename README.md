Spike of Kosli CLI documentation idea.  
Hovering over and clicking content auto scrolls related content in other dom elements into view.  
- Top section is Trails .kosli.yml file (rhs) and pane for commentary (lhs)   
- Middle section is crude mock-up of a Trail "washing line"
- Bottom section is Github Actions yml workflow (rhs) and pane for commentary (lhs)

- Note:
- Has minimal CSS styling
- Has minimal actual commentary in the lhs panes
- Requires docker, docker-compose, bash.  

After cloning the repo:
```
$ source scripts/shortcuts.sh
$ d
```

If port 80 is available, an html page will load in your default browser.
