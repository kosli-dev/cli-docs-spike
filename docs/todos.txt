The pairs argument to setupExplainHandlers() is redundant as the class names
are hard-wired at lines 47, 79

Maybe just add a "hover-area" next to each commentary paragraph
which when hovered over auto-scrolls the other dom elements into view.

Write some commentary.

CI yml could be tabbed, one tab for each CI system, [Github, Gitlab, CircleCI, etc]

Maybe highlight line numbers that have special hover behaviour?

.py module has parameters like this:
        (9, 2): "lint",
This needs to be more like this:
       ((5,1),(9,2)): ["artifact", "lint"]

Might be possible to make line numbers in the commentary act as auto-scrollers
to their corresponding lines.

Would be good to create a page with 2 sets of dom elements, each with their
own outer #id. And ensure that the auto-scolling of one does not leak into the other.

When setupExplainHandlers is declared const (and not var) then
when the (working) page loads you get an error message in the Javascript console.
Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'setupExplainHandlers' has already been declared
How is it being loaded twice?
