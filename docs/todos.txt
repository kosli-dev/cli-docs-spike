Write some commentary.

CI yml could be tabbed, one tab for each CI system, [Github, Gitlab, CircleCI, etc]

Maybe highlight line numbers that have special hover behaviour?

.py module has parameters like this:
        (9, 2): "lint",
This needs to be more like this:
       ((5,1),(9,2)): ["artifact", "lint"]

Might be possible to make line numbers in the commentary act as auto-scrollers
to their corresponding lines.

Would be good to create a page with 2 sets of dom elements, each with their
own outer #id. And ensure that the auto-scolling of one does not leak into the other.
