BUG: if you click on the leftmost attestation and then the
rightmost attestation, the latter does scroll into view in .kosli.yml

add class and CSS for line numbers

change cursor to indicate underlying behaviour on scrollover

change to scrollover instead of click?

would be nice if whole line (to far right, including ws) was hover/click able.
