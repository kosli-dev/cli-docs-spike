Always showing scrollbars doesnt work for yml (black background)

Maybe highlight line numbers that have special hover behaviour?

Have a single scroll behaviour:"smooth" for the partner dom element
eg hover ci-yml-commentary and smooth for ci-yml
eg hover ci-yml and smooth for ci-yml-commentary
and then drop always-showing scrollbar

# annotate.py

make data come in as a parameter somehow. dynamic import?

make hard-coded HTML in a parameter
    print("<div class='title'>Github Actions workflow</div>")
    print("<div class='ci-yml'>")

generate template-yml.html
