BUG: if you click on a ci-yml entry a few times, the 2nd/3rd time it scrolls out of view!

BUG: if you all the 3rd  highlight('ci-yml-commentary'); call
then the 2nd highlight('ci-yml'); seems to break

BUG: if you click on the leftmost attestation and then the
rightmost attestation, the latter does scroll into view in .kosli.yml

change to scrollover instead of click?
