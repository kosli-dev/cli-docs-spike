BUG: if you click on the leftmost attestation and then the
rightmost attestation, the latter does scroll into view in .kosli.yml

change cursor to indicate underlying behaviour on scrollover

change to scrollover instead of click?

when you scrollover a line, highlight all matching neighbouring lines
